Two medium sized warehouses located in California and the other in Illinois. Each warehouse is managed by 1 manager each with a total of five employees. We source high demand products such as electronics and clothing at low prices and selling them at a markup to overseas markets, primarily in Europe. Since it is focused on getting cheap items for markup it is partnered directly with LotteryLogistics to give our clients the ability to sell it directly on site without having to find buyers or slow payout times.
